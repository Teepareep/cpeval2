cpeval2
=======

cpeval2 is a modified version of the original cpeval, which was written by Brian Oates.

cpeval provided useful enviromental information to migrations specialists prior to
copying accounts. cpeval2 does the same, and also outputs information that can be
used by cpeval2 that analysts can copy/paste into tickets. This greatly automates
the task of pre migrations server analysis.
