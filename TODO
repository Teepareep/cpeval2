 TODO

 1) Compare the disk space output, and:
  a) print to STAFF if a different partition / $tarroot needs to be used
  b) print to CUSTOMER if there isn't enough free space to do the migration
  c) print to CUSTOMER if used space is less than half of free space, since
     the largest account we could copy would be ((used space / largest account ) - a few GB)

 2) Check for MySQL username conflicts

 3) Add a PHP handler check - s:Plesk8:PHPHANDLER:dso   d:PHPHANDLER:suphp

 4) Check for Postgres on both boxes.

 5) If the source has the snmp PHP module, print a message to install net-snmp-devel on destination

 6) Check for username.tar.gz files in /home([^/)?/ on destination, which can disrupt a restore

 7) Check openssh-clients package on source

 8) Check if any of the domains from the source already exist on the dest

 9) Fix "NAT Detected!" when NAT check doesn't work due to outbound 80 being blocked
